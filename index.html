            Kaleigh is 33 years old and lives in Fort Mill, SC. She spent the first half of her life moving around
            the midwest, then moved to Fort Mill in '98. At 19, she went to school to be a massage therapist and
            graduated from massage school in '05. She was a massage therapist for 13 years before she
            decided to make a huge jump into the world of coding. She chose coding because it was something she had
            done back in the day when she was much younger. Her keyboarding teacher encouraged her to go into computer
            science after seeing her fan page that she made for the Backstreet Boys. She wouldn't give it a second
            thought
            until years and years later when her brother, who is in IT himself, consistently nagged her.
            Kaleigh recently graduated from UNCC's Coding Bootcamp for Full Stack Web Development in March where she discovered
            a passion for backend development. She also really enjoyed learning and working with JavaScript, React, and most of all API integration.</p>

            One of Kaleigh's major passions is dog rescue. She has been fostering for several local area rescues since
            2013. She started specializing in pregnant and nursing mothers in
            November 2016 when she pulled a foster who surprised everyone and ended up being pregnant. Currently,
            Kaleigh is fostering a litter of 5 and their mom and dad. The puppies were born on April 15th. With this current litter, Kaleigh has now fostered 58 dogs.
